### FE React code assignment

### The objective of this challenge is to create a collection of recipes fetched from an API, render them, and style the list accordingly.
### A colleague has initiated the task, but it requires completion. Although finishing might be challenging, we aim to accomplish as many steps as possible.

### Some of the files we need to edit already include test files for verification.

- Step 1: Establish connection to the Recipe API and retrieve the data (src/api/getRecipes.ts)

- Step 2: Transform the API response into a suitable format for rendering the recipes (src/utils/mapApiResponseToRecipes.ts)

- Step 3: Integrate the API data into the React application (src/AppContext.tsx)

- Step 4: Display the list of recipes utilizing List and RecipeCard components (src/components/List and src/components/RecipeCard)

- Step 5: Ensure responsive layout for the list (src/components/List.module.css)

- Step 6: Rectify the CSS for recipe images in the card (src/components/RecipeCard.module.css)

- Step 7: Implement sorting functionality within the application (src/components/ToolBar.tsx)

- Step 8: Consider testing approaches for the application (App.test.tsx)
